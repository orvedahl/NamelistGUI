A GUI built using wxPython that reads/modifies/writes Rayleigh namelist files.

If the top directory of the NamelistGUI project is named NAMELIST_GUI, then the
easiest way to run the GUI is from the command line:

    python NAMELIST_GUI/namelistgui/input_gui.py

Default options that may be user/machine dependent are stored and described in the file

    NAMELIST_GUI/namelistgui/defaults.py

When the GUI is started, there are two menus:
    File
        New:
            Start an empty namelist project.
        Open
            Open an existing main_input file
        Save
            Save the modifications to a file, formatted as a standard Fortran namelist
        Quit
            Exit without saving.

    Namelists
        Once an input file is loaded or a namelist is added to an empty project, this menu
        will be populated with the available names of the individual namelists. When one
        is selected, its contents will be displayed in the main panel on the left. To modify
        an entry, select it and change the value accordingly. Character variables should include
        quotes and array entries should be separated by commas. The Save button in the namelist
        panel will save all changes to the currently selected namelist.

There are three shortcuts in the toolbar, represented by three picture icons. These shortcuts
include New, Open, and Save. They are aliases to the corresponding File menu options.

The buttons on the right hand side include:

    Open
        Open an existing main_input file
    Write
        Save the modifications to a file, formatted as a standard Fortran namelist
    New/Remove Variable
        Once an input file has been loaded (or a new project started) and a particular namelist has
        been chosen, a new variable can be added and a variable can be removed at the push of the
        appropriate button.
    New/Remove Namelist
        Once an input file has been loaded, an entire namelist can be added and/or removed with
        the appropriate button.

Special considerations for the Output_Namelist:

    When the output_namelist is selected, an additional button appears at the top named
    Choose "<output>_values". This button provides an alternate way to enter the
    quantity codes into the *_values variables.

    First select the desired output variable type, such as Shell_Avgs, AZ_Avgs, G_Avgs, etc.
    Next, select a diagnostic group type. Once a diagnostic group has been selected, all
    quantities associated with that group will be displayed in a table format below.
    Each row represents a specific quantity code, whose LaTeX representation is shown on
    the right (assuming use_tex=True in the defaults). Select the desired variables and
    then click the Save/Update button to save those values to the appropriate <output>_values
    variable. To add other output types, select a new output type from the drop-down selection
    and add the variables as before. Variables are only included if you hit the Save/Update
    button, simply selecting the Add button will not do anything by itself.

    The "Return" button will take you back to the standard namelist entry format for the
    Output_Namelist. If new variables were added, they should now appear in the appropriate
    <output_type>_values variable.
